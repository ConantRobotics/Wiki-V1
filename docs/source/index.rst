Welcome to Conant Robotics' documentation!
===================================

**Conant Robotics** is a robot combat club based in Conant High School in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.

It ordinarily competes in the annual [D214 Robot Rumble](https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20230217/robots-rumble-in-high-school-competition) in the lightweight/middleweight weight ranking with robots weighing 60 to 85 pounds.

This wiki is designed to contain information relevant to brainstorming, building, and battling robots using real Conant Robotics experience.

This is also a *living document*, so feel free to create addendums, add new sections, and generally improve the wiki with new contributions and new sections as you learn new things!

Check out the :doc:`about` section for further information about who made this and why, or just click around and read some of the articles!
